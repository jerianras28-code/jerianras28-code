## Hi there 👋

My expertise currently lies in n8n automation.
Since it was one of the most straight forward apps to get in to coding and learning coding logic.
I started with n8n around July of 2025. And I have gathered a good amount of experience and problem solving skills through the months.

But as of recently I started shifting my focus into actuall coding. and took a crash course on html, css, javascript and react.
I am currently messing around in next.js trying to get the hang of things.
With the idea start on my very first official project app.
to eventually reach the goal of having a fully fledged SAAS.
